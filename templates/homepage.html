                        2020! Such a worldwide fame!</p>

                        turns 8, thanks to her sister she learned how to read at 4 and never
                        stopped.</p>

                    <h1>Contests </h1>
                    <p>As a child, Christie loved the lavish feasts that were prepared at Christmas.
                        She would engage in eating contests with a friend and never get sick. She
                        loved everything but the oyster soup, and the food helped inspire her story
                        "The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding."</p>

                    <p>She was a dog lover. Her first dog was a Yorkshire Terrier puppy which she
                        received as a fifth birthday present. She was so overwhelmed with happiness
                        that she couldn't even say "thank you" and retreated to the lavatory to get
                        her thoughts together. The dog was named Tony– although his full name was
                        George Washington.</p>

                    <h1>A letter</h1>
                    <p>Christie was once surprised by a letter from a woman she'd never met who asked
                        Christie to adopt her! Christie was embarrassed and tried to decline as
                        politely as possible. That’s where probably the stan culture was born</p>

                    <p>The two things that excited her most in life were her car – the “grey

                        Buckingham Palace. Such a girlboss!</p>
